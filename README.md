## Context
It's been over 10 years since the Marvel Cinematic Universe began with over 20 superhero films created.
Through this project, I wanted to investigate the success of this franchise as well as its financial profitability.

## Objectives
This report aims to answer the questions below:

1. Link between Budget and IMBD rating (and metascore)
2. Return on Investment (ROI)
3. Correlation between Budget and Benefit
4. Favorite superhero

## The data
This data comes from [MCU complete dataset on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rachit239/mcu-complete-dataset) and it has been collecting by Rachit239 and web scraped from IMDb.com.
